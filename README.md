Useful Scripts to use for everyday GS activities

## av_match_sd.py

add this to your .bash_aliases and modify the path to program and path to folders  
python3 $HOME/[PATH TO PROGRAM]/av_match_sd.py ~/[PATH TO FOLDERS]/"$1"

Make sure to chmod +x global.py before you attempt to run it
 
When you run the command  
av_sd [FOLDER NAME WITH FILES INSIDE]
 
I personally make the folder name [mm-dd-yy] so that it is easy to remember and write  
Save files inside folder and then run script
